👋🏻 Hi, I’m Soumya! I create media and solutions that leverage the powerful intersection of Design, Computer Science & AI am currently enrolled at Parsons School of Design as a first-year MFA Candidate in Design & Technology, concentrating in Creative Coding & Data Visualization. I completed a BSc from Brown University in Applied Mathematics-Computer Science. I love to chat about Design, boutique coffee shops, Harry Potter or pretty much anything, so reach out to me at karws352@newschool.edu or @soumyakarwa on Instagram :)
